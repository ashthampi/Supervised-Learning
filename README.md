Preprocessing:

Standardization: Ensured features contribute equally. Standardization ensures all features contribute equally by transforming them to have zero mean and unit variance

Logistic Regression: Predicts probabilities using a linear combination of features.
Decision Tree: Makes decisions by splitting data based on feature values.
Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees, reducing overfitting.
SVM: Separates data using a hyperplane.
k-NN: Classifies based on the majority class of nearest neighbours.

Model Comparison:
Best Model: Logistic Regression (0.9737 accuracy).
Worst Model: Decision Tree (0.9298 accuracy).
